#  Things that you should take care of 
#  (Or the mistakes I made during the trial run!)

If the SSID has spaces and other blank spaces and you enter it as it is — it will not work!
If the is a typo in the SSID you entered it will create a configuration but you won’t be able to connect.
You cannot run this in the simulator.
Your device should be running iOS 11.* or greater and your should be xcode 9.* or greater.
When you try to configure a network which is already configured — you will get an error.
Once you delete the app the configurations related to that app is also gone, poof!…
